Project 1: Strategic Visualization of ALM Data with Global Project Landscape Graph
Executive Summary
Project 1 will harness the power of data visualization to provide 'MyCorporation' with actionable insights into our project landscape. This initiative is about more than just tracking; it's about visually communicating our project data through a Global Project Landscape Graph and a suite of dashboards.

Objectives
To create a suite of visual tools that will track and display a range of project performance metrics in real-time.
To integrate a graph-based visualization offering a global perspective of the enterprise's projects with respect to key metrics.
Detailed Approach
1. Visualization Tool Selection:

Background: Selecting the right tools is critical for developing dynamic, interactive dashboards and a graph-based visualization of project data.
How-To: Evaluate and choose BI tools for their visualization capabilities, factoring in the ability to support a graph-based overview of projects.
Outcome: A carefully chosen set of BI tools capable of sophisticated data representation. (Visuals 1. Overview Metrics, 2. Resource Allocation Metrics, 3. Capacity and Load Metrics, 4. Risk Assessment Metrics, 5. Project Tracking Metrics, 6. Dependency Metrics, 7. Queueing Metrics)
2. Global Project Landscape Graph Development:

Background: To encapsulate the enterprise's project status in a single, comprehensive visual.
How-To: Deploy graph plotting libraries to represent projects as nodes within a network, with metrics influencing node color, size, and shape.
Outcome: A graph-based visualization that provides an immediate, intuitive grasp of the project portfolio's health and status. (Visuals 1. Overview Metrics, 4. Risk Assessment Metrics, 5. Project Tracking Metrics)
3. Dashboard Design and Development:

Background: Dashboards are critical for turning data into a story that stakeholders can quickly understand and act upon.
How-To: Construct dashboards that integrate the Global Project Landscape Graph with traditional data displays like Gantt charts for timeline tracking and heatmaps for risk analysis.
Outcome: A set of interactive dashboards that offer a detailed breakdown of project metrics. (Visuals 1. Overview Metrics, 2. Resource Allocation Metrics, 3. Capacity and Load Metrics, 4. Risk Assessment Metrics, 5. Project Tracking Metrics)
4. Data Preparation and Integration:

Background: The foundation of reliable visualization is a robust dataset.
How-To: Prepare and normalize the data to be compatible with direct queries from our chosen BI tools, ensuring that the dashboards always reflect the most current information.
Outcome: A dataset ready for real-time analysis and display. (Visuals 1. Overview Metrics, 2. Resource Allocation Metrics, 3. Capacity and Load Metrics, 4. Risk Assessment Metrics, 5. Project Tracking Metrics, 6. Dependency Metrics, 7. Queueing Metrics)
5. Metrics Implementation and Evaluation:

Background: Establishing clear metrics will allow us to track project performance and make informed decisions.
How-To: Implement and display key performance indicators within the dashboards, such as project counts, resource allocation, and risk levels.
Outcome: A suite of metrics that stakeholders can use to gauge performance and identify areas for action. (Visuals 1. Overview Metrics, 2. Resource Allocation Metrics, 3.
